* Have a workflow that allows you to visualize and update the weekly plan from the cli
* Have .Named extend all direct parent .Named classes
* Flatten structure of balloons (use forbidden symbols like @ for in the field name for this)

* Turn deflator into something that does not track, create a track class that takes as input a balloon and recursively finds all named balloons and tracks them

* Remove some unnecessary directories that are created in the db if they don't belong to any namespace
